# Use a Pre-Trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds

This project aimed to enhance my Python skills by developing an image classifier that identifies different dog breeds. 
I used a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task, leveraging its ability to learn key features from a vast dataset of 1.2 million images called ImageNet

## Getting Started

### install dependencies

- Each directory has a `requirements.txt` describing the minimal dependencies required to run the notebooks in that directory
- To install these dependencies with pip, you can issue `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## What techs I have used

- Python 3.10
- torchtext
- torchvision
- Pillow

## Project objectives

- Identifying which pet images are of dogs and which pet images aren't of dogs
- Classifying the breeds of dogs, for the images that are of dogs

## Checking Point

✅ Using Pytorch image classification algorithm with AlexNet, VGG, and ResNet decides on classifying images whether it is a dog or not a dog

✅ Identifying a dog's breed how accuracy the best classification algorithm works

✅ Examine how long each algorithm took to resolve the classification image in terms of runtime
